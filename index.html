  <h3>De Yie Lu</h3>
  <p>I am Malaysian-Taiwanese, born in Penang, Malaysia. Spent 7 years growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia during my primary school years before returning to Penang. I am able to speak English, Mandarin, Malay and Indonesian and still willing to pick up another language in the future such as French.  My hobbies are tenpin bowling, football (soccer) and gaming. I had an interest in IT since I was really young and would explore and play around with my parent’s computer. I also would disassemble electronics which are broken, as I am curious with hardwares and how it’s built.  My experience with IT is quite average with basic to intermediate knowledge in adobe softwares such as photoshop, lightroom, illustrator and premiere, basics in VB.net  and microsoft office a good understanding with excel and the basics of access.</p>

  <p class="w3-padding-8">In my Myer-Briggs test, I got the personality, Debater (ENTP-A). People with these type of personalities tend to be knowledgeable, quick thinkers, original, excellent brainstormers, charismatic and energetic.</p>
  <p class="w3-padding-8">For my online learning style test, I got 15% auditory, 40% visual and 45% tactile. As from the result, I’m mainly a tactile learner which means I learn best by touching and doing as I learn things best through physical movements, a ‘hands-on’ type of learner. </p>
  <p class="w3-padding-8">The last test that I’ve completed was a leadership style test which shows that I have a communicating vision which indicates that I am able to visualize a clear direction for my group as a leader and able to communicate plans to the group in an exciting manner which helps the group to be more passionate and more willing to achieve the goal as a whole</p>

  <p>For the Myers-Briggs test, my personality is The Consul Personality (ESFJ-A). Here it shows i am highly extroverted, observant, emotional, judging and assertive. </p>
  <p>The online learning style test shows I can learn well under conditions of Visual, Read/Write and Kinesthetic, scoring points of 12 for each. However under Aural, I scored a 9, suggesting it is not my most favourable learning method.</p>
  <p>The final test was a Big Five Personality test which displays my openness and agreeableness with others allowing myself to be flexible with other ideas. My results of extraversion support my results in the Myer-Briggs test of being outgoing and being a “people person”.</p>

<h2> Blockchain and cryptocurrency </h2>

<div class="w3-card w3-white">
<div class="w3-container">
<div class="w3-panel w3-padding-36">
    <p>Cryptocurrencies has been around since since late 2008, invented by an unidentified individual that goes by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto by introducing bitcoin and blockchain. The inventor’s goal was to develop an electronic cash system, using peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. (Nakamoto 2009) Since the invention of bitcoin, there are now over 900 different cryptocurrencies as of September 2017. (Brown 2017) </p>

    <p>Cryptocurrencies have similarities to traditional money that we use on a day to day basis as they also work as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency is all facilitated, authorized and logged in a technology known as the blockchain technology. Just like in a bank, all transactions needs to be recorded and for cryptocurrencies, blockchain is essentially the financial ledger to record transactions but this is done differently. Blockchain is decentralized, without a dedicated server or central authority but is instead stored on thousands of cryptocurrency user’s computers around the world which are under the same network. (Beigel 2016) This allows cryptocurrency to have a public transaction history which make it technically impossible to counterfeit. (TechQuickie 2014) But despite blockchain being available to public, users have complete anomility as blockchain doesn’t contain any personal information.</p>

    <p>There are a few ways in which cryptocurrencies can be obtained. Firstly, cryptocurrencies can be obtained by exchanging them using traditional money or accepting it as a form of payment as it is a medium of exchange. Other than that, cryptocurrencies can be obtained by a process called ‘mining’. This works by using a specialized software to solve complex mathematical problems and when a ‘miner’ finds the solution is awarded an amount of a certain cryptocurrency. Most ‘mining’ that happens presently are done by “pools”, which is basically a group of miners, combining their computing power to increase the chance of getting this reward when they solve the problem as a “pool”. When these “pools” of miners are big enough to a point that they control more than half of the network’s solving capacity which is known as a “51% attack”. (L.S. 2015) As a “pool” is able to gain more than 50% of the network, they are able to take control of the networks and reverse transactions, double-spend coins and halt the payments between users. (Investopedia n.d.) </p>

    <p>As of now, cryptocurrencies aren’t widely acceptable yet but are on the rise with more and more merchants accepting certain cryptocurrency as a payment. Cryptocurrencies also have different laws in different countries, whilst many countries allowed it, some chose to ban them completely and others approve trading and holding them, but banned as a payment method. In the future, cryptocurrency might replace national currencies and could be replacing around 25% of the national currencies by 2030 according to Thomas Frey. </p>

    <p>One of the reasons that cryptocurrencies has gain such popularity is due to the fact that most things are now done electronically and with the use of the advancing technology lead to the invention of blockchain which has now allowed money to be done digitally as well. Besides this, there are individual who seeks more freedom and hates the control of the government, this has lead them to use cryptocurrency with the anonymility it provides. (Argiro 2018)

	In recent years, cryptocurrency and blockchain has impacted the world in many ways and is likely to keep impacting the world, in both good and bad ways. Blockchain could be seen as a problem in the banking industry as they blockchain could replace banks as they both work as a ledger for financial transactions. (Schrodt 2018) As cryptocurrency has their transaction ledger decentralized on a massive scale, cryptocurrency doesn’t have any recourse to the US dollar which is the reserve currency of the global economy. Because of this, the mechanics of international trade, foreign relations, diplomacy and economic sanction will be impacted and cause the global economy to be “de-dollarize” which means that cryptocurrency could takeover the US dollar as the reserve currency of the global economy. (Medium n.d.) Some countries are putting cryptocurrencies to good use by creating their own state-owned cryptocurrency. This is especially beneficial for countries with weaker local currency due to inflation. Venezuela, which is attempting to climb out of inflation launched an oil-backed cryptocurrency called ‘petro’. </p>

    <p>As ‘mining’ is one of the only ways of obtaining cryptocurrency other than buying or exchanging, this has lead many people and even businesses to start ‘mining’ for cryptocurrencies. Hundreds of thousands of computers has built just for cryptocurrency mining, this has caused a shortage for certain computer parts such as graphics card, memory and even power supply. Due to this shortage, it has impacted the price of computer parts all around the world and affecting any members of the society that are planning to upgrade or buy a new computer as some of these parts have been marked up by up to a few hundred dollars with more expensive parts being marked up more on average.</p>
	Cryptocurrency and blockchain has mainly affected me and a few other people I know negatively with the increasing price for certain computer parts making it really costly for a new computer for to upgrade parts in a current build. Concurrently, I do have friends that have earned a fortune thanks to </p>

<h2> Autonomous Weapons </h2>
  <div class="w3-card w3-white">
  <div class="w3-container">
  <div class="w3-panel w3-padding-36">
<p>Lethal autonomous weapons or “killer robots” as people refer it to has recently come to light with technology leaders calling for a restriction or ban on these potentially dangerous machines. As the name states, these machines are programmed and are able to carry out destructive task with the possibility of it causing harm to people.</p>
<p>“Killer robots” are created through a mix of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence. Autonomous systems are machines that are capable of interacting with the real world such as robots and drones. Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human conscience or thinking in the form of technology. As machines such as self-flying drones are programmed with Artificial Intelligence, they are capable of undertaking tasks in the stead of humans and they are also able to make decisions based on their environment at hand. </p>
<p>The most evident use of this technology is mainly through automated drones (self-flying drones) or in military activities in warfare (automated weapon systems). Self-flying drones are used in delivery services such as Amazon to deliver parcels to receivers instead of having a human drive and drop off the package at the residence. These autonomous machines are able to “think” for themselves and choose the best option to undertake. </p>
<p>The technology is no longer in the development stage but now it is being able to be implemented into autonomous systems. There is always more development to be done to make the systems better however at the stage it is at now, there are more calls for autonomous weapons to be regulated or banned. The majority of the use of automated systems are for drones and driverless cars while there are also plans for more autonomous weapons which could prove lethal if unregulated.</p>
<p>An example of an autonomous weapon is the Taranis UCAV (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle) which was a project between UK Defence and BAE systems. It cost 185 million pounds to create and it was designed to carry guided bombs and missiles, travel at supersonic speed and be able to stealth so it goes unnoticed by radars. </p>
<p>Killer robots are likely to impact in environments of warfare. They are sent out instead of humans so that no human lives are at risk during wars and they are able to fight with weapons equipped on them such as automatic rifles. If they are used for ill means, it could cause widespread damage and possibly at times be lethal. Currently, unmanned drones are being used in modern warfare and are proving vital to all users as they can fly into enemy territory without being seen on the radar and they do not need to put human lives at risk.</p>
<p>The people who will be most affected are army personnel as they are the ones using autonomous weapons. The weapons are handed out to army personnel as a way to improve their current situation in modern warfare in an attempt to give them the ‘edge’ over other countries in technological advances. If killer robots were to be fully implemented, everyone would be affected as they become a threat to international security as a result of the risks they carry. </p>
<p>While this creates new jobs, it replaces current weapons that are manned as it now relies on AI to be able to make decisions and carry out the desired outcome without assistance from humans. As a result of autonomous weapons now being made possible, more creations involving autonomous weapons will be created and it may be limitless. </p>
<p>Under controlled environments, autonomous weapons won’t affect my daily life. However if it was not controlled, it can pose a threat to international security where everyone will be at risk of danger. If autonomous weapons such a robots are implemented to patrol the streets, it will make the environment feel “safer” however, the threat they pose to all civilians is not to be underestimated.</p>

<h2> Autonomous Vehicles </h2>
  <div class="w3-card w3-white">
  <div class="w3-container">
  <div class="w3-panel w3-padding-36">
    <p>Competing companies have developed autonomous vehicles that do not entirely depend on human interaction to drive. Different types of autonomous cars rely on varying amounts of human assistance for its functioning. These driverless cars have the capability to detect their environment and with advanced technology systems, navigate the vehicle. A combination of software and sensors are utilised in the development to allow vehicles to be mainly controlled autonomously.</p>
    <p> The technology that enables these vehicles to navigate without human input involve computer vision, laser lights, radar, global positioning system antennas, and odometry. Currently autonomous vehicles can employ cameras for computer vision to receive information on lane lines as well as the ability to locate surrounding cars. This equipment can detect the road traffic lights indicating vehicles whether to stop, slow down, or continue. A continuous stream of information is received by computer vision as the vehicle navigates within the environment.</p>
    <p>Laser lights along with radars have been implemented within some vehicles to collect input of the environment. These components are used to further calculate specific measurements including velocity and distance between obstacles whilst driving. Various autonomous vehicles make use of ultrasonic sensors where a sound wave is released. An echo is produced when a wave contacts an object which then provides the vehicle with the exact obstacle position. This allows the vehicles to pinpoint the precise coordinates of obstructions, preventing possible collisions with surroundings.</p>
    <p>Global positioning software is used for the vehicle to determine the best route when travelling to a certain destination and to provide an indication of where it is located. With a GPS, the software encoded in the vehicle can compute which route is most appropriate in terms of arrival times, amount of obstructions and main roads. The main human interaction that is essential for the functioning of autonomous cars is to input the destination through the system. </p>
    <p>The development of autonomous vehicles is rapidly advancing due to competition between car and technology businesses. Despite the progress made within this industry, completely autonomous vehicles that have no reliance on human input are yet to be released. It is likely for one to be available for public use within the next few years as the technology for this task has been developed. The vehicles are undergoing extensive testing to ensure that it is safe to drive on public roads if it does rely solely on the system software.</p>
